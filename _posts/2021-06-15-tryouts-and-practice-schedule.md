**Hello Shark Families!**

Thank you all for your patience as we gear up for an awesome 2021 season!

As many of you may have heard by now, the Needham Sharks Summer Swim Team will return for a modified 2021 season (!!!) in compliance with the Needham Board of Health and Needham Park and Recreation. The program will run from June 21 to August 12 on Mondays through Thursdays from 5:30-7:45 PM.

Some updates for you for planning purposes:

## 1. Tryouts:

As you've heard, in order to comply with the current pool capacity guidelines, each age group will be limited to 20 swimmers. Age group capacity will be determined based on tryouts which will take place on June 21st (the first day of the season) and June 22nd (if needed). 

***In order to try out, you must sign up at [tinyurl.com/tryoutsharks21](https://tinyurl.com/tryoutsharks21){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} -- this is important for our facility's capacity restrictions.***

If you have signed up for tryouts, you can expect a confirmation email from me soon! Tryout times are as follows:

**Monday, June 21**
- 8 & under tryouts 5:30-6:00
- 9 & 10 tryouts 6:00-6:30 (FULL)
- 11 & 12 tryouts 6:30-7:00 
- 13 & older tryouts 7:00-7:30 (FULL)

**Tuesday, June 22**
- 9 & 10 tryouts 6:00-6:30
- 13 & older tryouts 7:00-7:30

A few things to consider before trying out:
- Minimum requirements for the team are that swimmers are Needham residents, at least 5 years of age, and able to swim 25 yards (one length of the pool) of freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. All strokes will be assessed and tryout decisions will be subject to the coach's approval.  
- Swim Team is meant for swimmers who already have a basic knowledge of the four competitive strokes and stroke techniques.
- The season will last about 8 weeks, members who try out for the 2021 season must be able to make a minimum of 6 weeks of the season.
- Cuts will be made based on mastery of the strokes, endurance, and overall performance. This is particularly important this season as swimmers must be able to complete their practice sets without stopping in order to maintain social distance guidelines.

Tryouts will be free for all swimmers and cuts will be determined by June 22nd and registration must be paid by June 23rd. Swimmers who do not meet the requirements for the swim team this season are welcome to sign up for swim lessons to gear up for the 2022 season!

If your family is unable to try out for the team on June 21st and June 22nd (if necessary), they may be permitted to try out after the tryout dates if the age division has space and upon the coaching staff's later evaluation.

## 2. Practice Schedule

After tryouts on Monday 6/21 and Tuesday 6/22, swimmers and families will be notified if they have made the team. Our first team practice will be on Wednesday 6/23. Upon making the team, each swimmer should plan to attend the practice for their age group (listed below) unless notified otherwise. Attached is a copy of the team schedule with practice times. 

| 8 & UNDER | 9 & 10 | 11 & 12 | 13 & 14 | 15 - 18 |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 5:15-6:00 PM | 5:15-6:00 PM | 6:00-6:45 PM | 6:45-7:45 PM | 6:45-7:45 PM |


## 3. Meet Schedule

Our league has decided to proceed with in-person swim meets this season. This means our team will host a handful of meets at home and travel to the surrounding towns for a handful of away meets. Many more details to come regarding rules for spectators and meet details, however please consider your meet attendance for the season before committing to the team. This team is meant to be a competitive experience for our athletes, and just as there is an expectation to make a minimum of 6 weeks of the season the same expectation exists for attending swim meets whether away or at home. Our team does not provide transportation to away meets, so please consider transportation in your planning. The attached schedule includes meet dates and times (start times subject to change!). 

Due to current guidelines and facility limitations, our league will not be hosting a championship meet this season or the Mile Swim. So we'll have to really bring it in the dual meets to declare ourselves champions!!

If anyone has any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me or to Needham Park and Rec ([parkandrecreation@needhamma.gov](mailto:parkandrecreation@needhamma.gov)). In the meantime, keep healthy and safe and I hope to see you all soon ðŸ’™ðŸ¦ˆ
