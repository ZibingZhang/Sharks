**Hello, Potential Sharks!**

If you are receiving this email, you have successfully registered your athlete(s) for tryouts on Monday, June 21st.

All swimmers should come prepared to swim in a competitive one-piece swimsuit, with goggles and a swim cap. Once your athlete makes the team, more information will be provided regarding team suits and gear.

At tryouts, swimmers will have a chance to warm up briefly before being assessed by the coaching staff. Swimmers will line up and swim 25 yards (10&under) or 50 yards (11 & older) of each stroke. While swimming, coaches will be assessing swimmers on the following skills: 

- Ability to dive
- Ability to legally swim all four strokes
  - 25 yards for 10 & under
  - 50 yards for 11 & older, including a flip turn or legal turn
- Time in each event

Once your athlete has been assessed in all four strokes, you are free to go! The coaching staff will be making decisions over the course of Monday and Tuesday's tryouts and you will hear back from us on Tuesday night if you have or have not made the team!

Once you've made the team, you will receive an email from Park and Rec regarding registration and payment.

Thank you, see you soon, and good luck!
