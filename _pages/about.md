For over 30 years, the Needham Swim Team has provided opportunities for Needham boys and girls to refine their swimming skills in a fun and competitive environment. Our goal is to develop swimmers with a good foundation of competitive swimming skills in a fun and supportive environment. We take pride in teaching non-swimmers and watching them develop into swimmers. But we also want to build character, self-esteem, sportsmanship, determination, and lifelong friendships.

Practices are held Monday through Thursday at Needhamâ€™s Rosemary Pool. All Needham children ages 7 - 18 years old are welcome. Be aware that children 8 years and younger will be required to demonstrate that they can swim 25 yards in a variation of pool depths.

Our mission is to develop swimmers with a good foundation of competitive swimming skills in a fun and supportive environment. Our main focus throughout the season is stroke technique of all four competitive strokes, starts, and turns. Our coaching staff hopes to provide new swimmers and veteran swimmers with a strong foundation of competitive swimming fundamentals so they can be successful at the recreational, YMCA, USA, High School, and Collegiate Levels should they choose that path.
