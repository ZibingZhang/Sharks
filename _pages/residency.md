A proof of residency is required for all swimmers (one per family). Copies of a recent utility bill or a driver's license must be provided. If the swimmer has a different last name THAN THEIR PARENT, a birth certificate or passport must also be provided. New copies must be obtained every year, and the old copies will be shredded.
