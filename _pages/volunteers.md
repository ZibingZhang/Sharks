Parent volunteers at swim meets and other team events are crucial to the team's success. A parent from each family must sign up to volunteer for 2 meets, either home or away. The team will compete in ten swim meets over the course of the season. The meets are on Tuesday and Thursday nights for the most part. The more help we have from parents, the better the meet will run and the more fun the swimmers AND their parents will have. If you are unable to assist at the meets, please be sure to communicate with the coaches.

## Volunteer Activities

### 1. Judging the finish of the races 

Although this sounds difficult, it is really very easy.  We need a parent to simply stand at the finish end of the pool.  When the race is done you will simply signify which place the swimmers came in: first, second, first.  You are not alone.  An experienced judge will assist you and there is usually another parent from the opposing team judging you.  

### 2. Scorekeeping

We need one parent at each meet to handle this responsibility.  A more experienced scorer will help you.  The scorekeeping simply tracks the points scored in each race.  Again, you are not alone as the opposing team has a scorer assigned to the same task to insure a fair and accurate tally.

### 3. Timers 

Timing our swimmers helps the coaches track a swimmer's progress.  The coaches will decide which meets they want timed.

### 4. Stroke and Turn Judges

We are required to provide a certified stroke and turn judge for each meet.  The league has classes and certification for this position.  We always need parents who are willing to become certified.  Judges can help swimmers to understand why they might have been disqualified and to correct these problems for the future.
